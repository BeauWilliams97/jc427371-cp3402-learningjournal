# **Learning Activities & Resources**
This week we had a meeting and discussed our thoughts/feelings/plans for assignment 2. 

The main resources used this week were [Github](https://github.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/) and the [Underscores starter theme](https://underscores.me/).

The main learning activity this week was focused on understanding how to go about creating/editing a WordPress starter theme. To do so, personally, I watched the lecture videos for both week 8 and week 9. I also did some reading up on [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) documentation.

# **Estimated Hours & Content Insights**
Our group meeting went for roughly an hour and a half. I then spent around 3 hours on independent learning.

# **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
The first career/employability insights that come to my mind from this week is the ability to communicate with team member(s) in order to work towards a common goal, and the ability to collaborate on documentation to effectively communicate progress/updates on project work. 

Another notable career/employability insight from this week is time management/adaptability. I believe time management and a degree of adaptability was exercised this week, as we all had to agree upon a time to meet, and we also set some deadlines for up and coming project milestones. 

Some learning insights from this week:

Understanding the value of incorporating feedback from team members/clients in order to improve my skills and deliver better content/results.

Enhancing documentation skills by learning how to use Trello Board/GitHub.
