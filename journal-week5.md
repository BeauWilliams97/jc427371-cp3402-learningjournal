# **Learning Activities & Resources**
Once again, I used VVV to set up a dynamic site with a database running on my localhost. This week, however, I created a child theme based on the WordPress twentytwenty theme. 

I used the following tutorial/documentation to understand how to create child theme(s):

# **Estimated Hours & Content Insights**
Roughly 2-3 hours.

After working very briefly with PHP this week, I developed a basic understanding of the syntax. In relation to this, an obvious insight is that PHP has a very similar syntax to Java.

Another insight from this week is why enqueue is used, as well as its importance when creating a child theme. From my understanding, the enqueue function is used to add or "enqueue" scripts and stylesheets. This is essential when creating a child theme in WordPress for a number of reasons, but most importantly, it is used to preserve parent theme functionality. Enqueuing allows the child theme to load its own scripts and stylesheets without interfering with or overriding the scripts and stylesheets loaded by the parent theme. This ensures that the child theme can extend or modify the functionality of the parent theme without breaking its core features.

# **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
Creating a child theme primarily served to hone my technical skills in HTML, CSS, and PHP. It could also be said that it improved my attention to detail. 

Additionally, knowing how to create a child theme could potentially be a valuable addition to a future resume/portfolio, as it showcases a certain level of expertise in WordPress development. It also likely shows that if I was a developer, I would be able to collaborate with clients more effectively and meet any particular customisation requests they might have.
