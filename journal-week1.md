# H1 **Learning Activities & Resources**
This week I made a very simple website by combining and customising multiple Bootstrap examples which I then published to GitHub Pages. This practical was a much needed refresher, as I have not done anything HTML or CSS in a very long time. 

Used [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) multiple times, used both the Carousel and Navbar components.


[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGcuxuhV-Jg&t=300s) was a useful tutorial which I used to understand deploying to GitHub pages.

Initially, I tried to install npm via command line but wasn't 100% about what exactly I needed to import. Was finally able to get it working by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhiQCQITyq0) and using CDN links.

Used [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) in order to understanding formatting for journal.

Used [this](https://stackedit.io/) to format and preview journal before committing.

Realised I can just use Visual Studio code to create my journal entries by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLLrcr9u_XI).

# H2 **Estimated Hours & Content Insights**
I would say I spent roughly 8 hours this week trying understand the content. A lot of that time was spent lost, playing with different hosting, trying to install bootstrap, learning to use Visual Studio Code etc. 
I'm glad I took the time to complete this weeks practical even though I missed the submission date, as I now feel much more confident going into next week. HTML and CSS aren't new to me - I have taken this
subject before in the past, however Bootstrap is something I never used the first the time around so it was cool to have a play around with it. 

# H2 **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
It would be fair to say that I now have a better chance at getting a job as a web developer than I did at the start of the week haha. 

Visual Studio Code is awesome and I can definitely see myself using it again.

I currently work in IT support and we use Azure. I look forward to experimenting with it and using it for hosting later in the semester.
