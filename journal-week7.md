# **Learning Activities & Resources**
A learning activity that I assigned myself this week, was understanding the difference(s) between XXAMP and LAMP (more on this in learning insights). After doing some reading, I decided to trial XXAMP as my local development environment for this weeks prac. However, it is important to note that I also used LAMP. Both stacks were used this week to set up a dynamic site with a database running on my localhost.

Initially, I was using Vagrant + VVV coupled with the LAMP stack -[CognacBox Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Shl6tS5zE&t=347s). Learning how to set this up was quite straight forward; I followed along with the tutorial provided by Lindsay, where he set up Scotch Box, and I also referred to the documentation on the CognacBox GitHub. 

As mentioned previously, I decided to trial [XXAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). XXAMP is icredibly easy to set up. One click install, and then run the XXAMP control panel. From there you can launch all required services. Very self explanatory. 

I followed along with this tutorial - [Signup and Login with PHP and MySQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L9UhOnuos0&t=2136s) to understand how to implement sign up/login/logout functionality in php. I made slight adjustments to the syling of the forms as well as the positioning of the logged in/logged out status. Familiarising myself with the basics of PHP was probably the most challenging learning activity this week. 

# **Estimated Hours & Content Insights**
I spent roughly 5 hours on this weeks prac.

One notable content insight, based on this weeks learning activities, is that XXAMP is much easier to set up and use than LAMP. I understand most web servers are Linux based, however the simplicity and flexibility of XXAMP is hard to look past. This combined with the fact that it's essentially a one-click install/launch. I will be using XXAMP for all local development from this point onwards. I also plan to recommend it to my group members for Assignment 2. 

# **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
I learned that XAMPP and LAMP are both software stacks used for web development, and I also learned about some of their key differences. For exmaple:

XAMPP (which stands for Cross-platform, Apache, MariaDB/MySQL, PHP, Perl) is designed to be cross-platform, meaning it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. As a result, XXAMP is a lot easier to set up; providing a straightforward way to install a full web development environment on your local machine. XXAMP is most definitely something I will be using again for local development.

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP/Perl/Python) is specifically designed for Linux operating systems. As a result, LAMP typically requires a more manual setup, especially on non-Linux systems. Personally, I won't be using LAMP for local development again. 

Learning how to create and link a database to PHP is also something incredibly useful that I learnt this week, and undoutedbly something I will use again in the future; definitely during Assignment 2 and perhaps even in a future job. 
 
I believe majority of the content practiced this week is useful and increases employability in the IT industry.
