# Learning Activities & Resources
A learning activity that I assigned myself this week, was familiarising myself with SASS. To do so, I read through the documentation on their official website - [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) to understand the fundamentals such as variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance.

I used the 'Live Sass Compiler' extension in Visual Studio Code to compile my .scss files. No other task runners were used as automation beyond this was not necessary because it was all done locally.

I wanted to practice setting up and using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) in anticipation for Assingment 2, as I was planning to implement it in the group project. I followed [How to Install Bootstrap with NPM (Best Way)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPAiTlQr7no&t=181s) to help me get it set up, in this context. 

## Estimated Hours & Content Insights

I dedicated about 4 hours this week to the entire process, from learning to application:

A key insight from this week's activities is the power of Sass in web development. Its features like variables and mixins not only simplify CSS coding but also make it easy to maintain. The automation via Live Sass Compiler proved to be a time-saver; once set up, it handled Sass compilation seamlessly, which ultimately enhanced my workflow efficiency.

Another key content insight from this week came from the implementation of Bootstrap. Bootstrap can significantly speed up the design process of web development projects due to its comprehensive library of pre-styled components and responsive grid system. Bootstrap, as a front-end framework, provides developers with ready-to-use CSS and JavaScript components that are both responsive and customisable. This means that developers can focus more on functionality and less on basic styling.

Additionally, the use of Bootstrap can also lead to more maintainable and scalable codebases. Since Bootstrap operates on a set of standard practices and uses a consistent framework, it's easier for teams to work collaboratively. New team members can quickly understand the structure and styling conventions, making it easier to maintain and update the website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The experience of integrating Sass and Bootstrap into a web development project could potentially significantly boost a developerâ€™s marketability and adaptability in the web development industry. Both tools are widely utilised and valued for their efficiency and capability to produce robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications. 

By developing a funamental understanding of Sass, I believe I also gained a deeper understanding of stylesheet management. This might be particularly attractive to potential employers looking for candidates who can streamline front-end development and maintain style consistency across large projects.

Similarly, knowledge of how to implement Bootstrap has equipped me  with the skills necessary to rapidly prototype and build responsive websites that adhere to modern user interface standards. This is a crucial competency in a market where mobile-first design is not just preferred but expected. It seems like developers who are adept at using Bootstrap can often step into roles that demand quick turnovers and high-quality outputs, making them great candidates for front-end development positions.

Furthermore, these skills enhance a developer's ability to work effectively in team settings, where understanding and applying best practices in CSS frameworks and responsive design are essential. The collaborative nature of many tech environments means that the ability to contribute to and improve upon existing codebases with tools like Sass and Bootstrap is highly sought after. Thisdefinitely opens up more career opportunities.
