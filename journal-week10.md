# Learning Activities & Resources
A learning activity that I assigned myself this week was researching and reviewing a bunch of WordPress security plugins, and creating a list of pros and cons for each. I trialed most of the plugins listed on this [WPBeginner Article](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/best-wordpress-security-plugins-compared/). I tested the plugins on a site I set up locally using XAMPP. 

Another learning activity was researching how to properly strucutre a speech for the presentation. I took some inspiration from the [following site](https://virtualspeech.com/blog/how-to-structure-your-presentation). 

# Estimated Hours & Content Insights
I probably spent 2-3 hours in total on the content from this week. 
A few content insights:

## WordPress
Understanding WordPress security is crucial due to the platform's vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and XSS, which are frequently exploited by hackers. 

Regular updates, careful management of plugins and themes, and adherence to security best practices like using strong passwords and implementing two-factor authentication are essential for maintaining site integrity. 

Itâ€™s also important to have a response plan for security breaches and comply with data protection laws like GDPR to protect sensitive information. WordPress security is vital not only for safeguarding personal and financial data but also for maintaining user trust, avoiding financial losses, ensuring continuous website availability, and supporting SEO efforts. Having good security measures is far less costly and disruptive compared to the consequences of a security breach.

## Presentation
Recording a presentation with my team provided valuable insight into the necessity of thorough preparation, including scripting and rehearsing, to ensure all team members understand their roles for a smooth, concise delivery. 

Technical setup is crucial. There needs to be good sound quality, and everyones voice must be heard. In relation to this, it's best to conduct a few pre-recording tests before any actual trials. 

It's important to employ engagement techniques such as interactive elements and effective use of visuals to maintain audience interest and compliment our speeches. 

Giving eachother feedback from trial recordings can lead to significant improvements in content and delivery, highlighting the importance of iteration. 

Effective collaboration and coordination among team members is definitely essential for smooth transitions and cohesive content coverage. 

Post-recording, basic video editing skills would have been super helpful to enhance the final product by refining audio-visual quality and adding necessary overlays or captions.
